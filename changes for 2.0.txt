Major changes w/ htcw_gfx 2.0

Cutting floor:

Complete removal of driver integration, so no more "async" draw destinations, or write only draw destinations, etc, greatly simplifying the code.
Rationale: Even with those facilities in place, it's still faster to draw to bitmaps and then send bitmaps to the screen. It takes a little bit more memory, but it's always worth it.
On the other hand, the zoo that was the template specialization chains necessary to fully utilize a display device (batching, async, etc) was creating a maintenance problem.

Rearrangements:

svg_doc has been superseded by svg_image

All images (png,jpg,svg) derive from a common base class (gfx::image) and you can add more

All fonts (ttf, vlw, fon) now derive from a common base class (gfx::font), and gfx::font has been superseded by gfx::win_font

Primary additions:

Text and images can now be post-processed during the render by using font.draw() and image.draw() with their respective callbacks.

Text encoding is now pluggable, and should present no huge changes for anyone, but allows for adding additional encodings other than latin1 and utf8
